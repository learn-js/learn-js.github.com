Check out this simple implementation of pong I made in a few hours last night: [sethvincent.github.io/digital-table-tennis-for-two](http://sethvincent.github.io/digital-table-tennis-for-two)

It's made using [crtrdg.js](http://crtrdg.com), a 2d toolkit for making games that leverages [browserify](http://browserify.org) for writing node-style javascript modules for the browser.

Here's the source on GitHub: [github.com/sethvincent/digital-table-tennis-for-two](http://github.com/sethvincent/digital-table-tennis-for-two).

It turns out I’ve been experimenting with making silly games for about a year!

At this time last year making even a dumb little game was a struggle. Yesterday I made a pong rip-off in a few hours. I’m happy about that.

I made this pong game as a quick warm-up for a "gaming for good" game jam I'm attending this weekend. A chance to test my tools to make sure everything is working properly. crtrdg.js is working well for me as a rapid prototyping tool. I learned to program with Processing, and that's informed some of my decisions in creating crtrdg.js.

I find that crtrdg.js works pretty great for game jams – quick projects where the stakes are low and the goal is to get an idea out fast. 

Here's a post about what I learned from participating in Ludum Dare, an awesome game jam that inspired me to first start participating in that kind of event: [What I learned from Ludum Dare 27](http://superbigtree.tumblr.com/post/59937961490/what-i-learned-from-ludum-dare-27).

Also check out this post that shows example usage of crtrdg.js: [Creating animations with javascript, the canvas tag, and crtrdg.js](http://superbigtree.tumblr.com/post/62030587562/creating-animations-with-javascript-the-canvas-tag). And this post about getting started making 2d games: [A super simple starting point for 2d javascript games](http://learnjs.io/blog/2013/11/16/simple-2d-game/).

### Learn.js book series updates.

I'll be including a chapter on how to make pong in the next update to the Learn.js book on 2d games. The next update will happen before the end of January.

[Pre-order the 2d games book for $10](http://gum.co/learnjs02) or the [4-book bundle of the Learn.js series for $25](http://gum.co/bundle01) to get updates as they are released.

I'd love to hear about the types of games or other projects you're working on, or that you'd like to make. Hit me up at hi@learnjs.io!
